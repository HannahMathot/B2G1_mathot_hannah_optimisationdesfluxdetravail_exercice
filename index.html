    <h1>The Owl House</h1>
    <p>Luz Noceda is a teenage Dominican-American human girl from 
        Gravesfield, Connecticut who accidentally stumbles upon a portal 
        to another world instead of going to a juvenile detention summer 
        camp. She arrives on an archipelago known as the Boiling Isles, 
        formed from the remains of a dead Titan, and befriends the 
        rebellious witch Eda Clawthorne (alias "The Owl Lady") and her 
        adorable demon roommate King. Despite not having magical abilities, 
        Luz pursues her dream of becoming a witch by serving as Eda's 
        apprentice at the Owl House and ultimately finds a new family in 
        an unlikely setting.
